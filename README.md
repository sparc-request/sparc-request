The current stable branch is v1.7.0

SPARC (Services, Pricing, and Applications for Research Center) is a web based research management system that integrates research and clinical care workflows with a focus on service request catalog, billing compliance, proposal and budget development, work fulfillment data collection, invoicing and billing, and impact data through grants and publication associations.

The system is open source with the capability to encompass multiple institutions, institutional entities, and service providers and programs.  

The intuitive user interface derives from a concept of online shopping.  A quick click budget template with preselected defaults, researcher dashboard and notification system linked with an email client, pick lists to pre-populate fields for project and personnel data previously entered into the system are just some of the investigator-driven features of this system.  The ability to choose research and clinical services from across multiple institutions and institutional entities (such as research centers, hospitals, and physician and advanced practice nurse practice plans), designate a funding source for each service, upload pertinent documents, and request and obtain review of the requested services provides an integrated platform that can inform sponsored grants and contracts budget development and negotiation and provide a consolidated service request process for all research projects.
