Steps to install SPARC on existing instance

1. sudo su && useradd capistrano
2. add capistrano to rvm group (/etc/group)
3. su capistrano
4. rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p286
5. rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p286@sparc --create
6. cd ~ && mkdir .ssh
7. paste public keys into .ssh/authorized_keys
8. chmod 700 .ssh
9. chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
10. copy id_rsa from /home/capistrano/.ssh on obis-sparc-dev.mdc.musc.edu
11. chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
12. git clone git@github.com:HSSC/sparc-rails.git and make sure you can connect to git
13. rm -rf sparc-rails to removed the cloned directory
14. exit
15. rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p286@sparc --create (you should be root user now)
16. gem install passenger
17. yum install httpd httpd-devel curl-devel
18. exit to regular user and rvmsudo passenger-install-apache2-module
19. copy the following into /etc/httpd/conf.d/passenger.conf

   LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286@sparc/gems/passenger-3.0.19/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   PassengerRoot /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286@sparc/gems/passenger-3.0.19
   PassengerRuby /usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p286@sparc/ruby

20. mkdir rails && chown capistrano:capistrano rails
21. vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/sparc.conf and paste the following

NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/rails/sparc-rails/current/public

    PassengerLogLevel 3
    RackEnv staging

    <Directory /var/www/rails/sparc-rails/current/public>
      Allow from all
      Options -MultiViews
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

22. su capistrano && cd /var/www/rails
23. FROM LOCAL: cap ENV deploy:setup
24. back on server, cd sparc-rails/shared && mkdir config
25. vi config/database.yml and add something like this

redh

26. vi config/application.yml and add something like this

staging:
  default_mail_to: 'glennj@musc.edu'
  admin_mail_to: 'success@musc.edu'
  dashboard_link: 'https://sparc-stg.mdc.musc.edu/dashboard/'

27. vi config/setup_load_paths.rb and add something like this

if ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'] && ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'].include?('rvm')
  begin
    gems_path = ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'].split(/@/)[0].sub(/rubies/,'gems')
    ENV['GEM_PATH'] = "#{gems_path}:#{gems_path}@sparc"
    require 'rvm'
    RVM.use_from_path! File.dirname(File.dirname(__FILE__))
  rescue LoadError
    raise "RVM gem is currently unavailable."
  end
end

# If you're not using Bundler at all, remove lines bellow
ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] = File.expand_path('../DeployGemfile', File.dirname(__FILE__))
require 'bundler/setup'

28. switch back to root user

29. mysql create the database you specified in database.yml

30. FROM LOCAL: cap ENV deploy:cold

NOTE: had to yum install libxslt-devel

31. /etc/init.d/httpd configtest - if this is good you can proceed

32. /etc/init.d/httpd start

33. FROM LOCAL: cap ENV deploy

34. visit http://obis-sparc-rails-ENV.mdc.musc.edu and you should see the app

35. load data/documents

36.  ssh sctrwebstg12.mdc.musc.edu and edit the appropriate /etc/httpd/conf.d/sparc-stg.musc.edu.conf (this example is staging).  Others could be testing or training
       ssh obisproxyprod0-v.musc.edu and edit vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/sparc.musc.edu.conf for production

       Edits would be to change the secure location to /identities/auth/shibboleth/callback
       May have to add the following

       <Location /Shibboleth.sso>
         PassengerEnabled off
       </Location>

       Change the proxy settings to port 80
