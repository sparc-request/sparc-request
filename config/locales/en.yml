          question_2: "May I select and add services from multiple Service Providers and Programs at one time?"
          answer_2: "Yes. Please feel free to browse, select, and add services from any Service Provider, Program, and/or Core displayed in the system for any given research study/project."
          question_3: "How many Authorized Users can I add?"
          answer_3: "Add as many Authorized Users as you feel is pertinent. There is no limit."
          question_4: "What is the difference  between a Research Study and a Project?"
          answer_4: "A Research Study is an individual research protocol with defined aims and outcomes."
          question_5: "How is SPARCRequest calculating my indirect costs?"
          answer_5: "The original requester for your study/project defined both the funding source of the study/project and the indirect cost rate. SPARCRequest uses this data to calculate your total overall indirect costs."
