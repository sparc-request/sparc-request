# Stub out all the methods in ApplicationController so we're not testing

# to query the identities table for the record with id session[:identity_id].
# Sometimes it's desirable to use a mock Identity object; do stub_controller(obj: <mock identity>)
# in this case. If you don't want to use the session variable, do stub_controller(id: <identity id>).
