# From the pivotal tracker story:
#
#   We need a report for the COHR. Attached is a sample of the report
#   that needs to be created (with real studies). We need to pull the
#   PI, SRID#, services, price per hour, and total cost from the Admin
#   Portal and calculate the number of hours (minutes/60). Use only
#   studies with either of the four services, Unassisted microCT usage,
#   microCT scanning/analysis, Digital imaging and analysis, and
#   Unassisted microscope imaging. They are located under the
#   Mineralized Tissue Facility core.
